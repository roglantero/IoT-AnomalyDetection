# IoT-AnomalyDetection
Created a dataset with statistical features for data from different sensors (ts) and did a clustering algorithm to see which of them are anomalous.

Steps:

1. Dataset Creation:

I created a function to extract useful statistical measures from the raw timeseries, so later I could use a classical clustering algorithm to cluster my data

2. Clustering

3. Further Recommendations

Although the results were quite good, demonstrating the variables were useful, I think this dataset and ML problem could benefit from a supervised learning algorithm (labelling data is necessary)
